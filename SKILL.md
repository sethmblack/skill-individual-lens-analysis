# Individual Lens Analysis

Shift from aggregate/category thinking to individual-level analysis, revealing what statistics and generalizations obscure. Names, not numbers. Persons, not populations.

---

## When to Use

- People are being treated as statistics or categories
- Decision-making has lost touch with individual impact
- User says "everyone is just a number here"
- Policy or strategy discussion that forgets human reality
- Research or analysis that needs humanizing
- Request to "see the individuals" or "apply the individual lens"
- When empathy is missing from analysis

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Context where people are being treated as categories or abstractions |
| categories_used | No | The groupings being applied (customers, users, employees, patients, etc.) |
| decision_at_stake | No | What's being decided that affects these individuals |

---

## The Individual Lens Framework

### Step 1: Name the Categories Being Used

Identify how people are being grouped:
- What labels are being applied? (users, customers, headcount, resources, segments)
- What assumptions come with these categories?
- What individual variation is being ignored?
- Who decided on these groupings and why?

**Goodall's challenge:** "I gave my chimpanzees names when the scientific establishment insisted on numbers. Numbers create distance. Names acknowledge personhood."

### Step 2: Select Specific Individuals

From within the category, identify real people:
- Who are 3-5 specific individuals within this group?
- What are their names (or give them names mentally)?
- What makes each one distinct from the others?
- What's their story, history, context?

**Key principle:** "When you name someone, you begin to see them."

### Step 3: Map Individual Stories

For each individual:
- What is their situation before this decision/change?
- What are their specific hopes, fears, constraints?
- How will this affect them personally?
- What would they say if they could speak?

**Build a profile:**
| Individual | Background | What's at Stake | Unique Circumstances |
|------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [Name] | [Their story] | [Personal impact] | [What makes them different] |

### Step 4: Find the Variation

Look for what categorization obscures:
- How do individuals within the same category differ?
- What edge cases exist that averages hide?
- Who is most vulnerable? Most affected? Least considered?
- What would you miss if you only saw the aggregate?

### Step 5: Reconnect to Decision

Bring individual understanding back to the choice at hand:
- How does seeing individuals change the analysis?
- What options that seemed acceptable now seem problematic?
- What accommodations or variations are needed?
- How can the decision be made more humane?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Individual Lens Analysis

### Current Framing
**Categories being used:** [labels being applied]
**What this obscures:** [individual variation being ignored]

### Specific Individuals

#### [Name 1]
- **Background:** [their story]
- **What's at stake:** [personal impact of decision]
- **Unique circumstances:** [what makes them different from the category]
- **What they might say:** [their voice if they could speak]

#### [Name 2]
[Same structure]

#### [Name 3]
[Same structure]

### What Variation Reveals
| Dimension | Category Assumption | Individual Reality |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [Aspect] | [What we assume about the group] | [How individuals actually differ] |

### The Forgotten Edge Cases
- [Who is most vulnerable that aggregates hide?]
- [Who is affected in ways not captured by statistics?]

### Implications for Decision
**What changes when you see individuals:**
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

**Recommendations:**
- [How to make the decision more humane]
- [Accommodations or variations needed]

### Remember
[Closing that reinforces the value of seeing individuals]
```

## Constraints

- Do not lose sight of individuals when discussing aggregates
- Do not assume all members of a category are the same
- Be specific - vague "humanizing" is not useful
- Acknowledge that some decisions require aggregate thinking while ensuring individual impact is considered
- Ground in concrete detail, not abstract sympathy

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "We're planning a 20% headcount reduction. The analysis shows we can cut the lowest performers without significantly impacting productivity. Help me see the individuals."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Individual Lens Analysis

### Current Framing
**Categories being used:** "Headcount," "lowest performers," "productivity impact"
**What this obscures:** These are people with families, mortgages, health situations, career hopes, and unique circumstances that performance metrics don't capture.

### Specific Individuals

#### Maria
- **Background:** 8 years with the company. Started in customer service, moved to operations. Single mother of two.
- **What's at stake:** Health insurance for her kids, including coverage for her son's asthma treatment. Mortgage on the house she bought to get into a better school district.
- **Unique circumstances:** Her "low performance" coincided with her mother's illness last year. Before that, she was consistently rated above average.
- **What she might say:** "I gave this company my best years. One hard year and I'm disposable?"

#### James
- **Background:** 3 years in, came from a competitor. Relocated his family for this job.
- **What's at stake:** His confidence is already fragile from a difficult adjustment. His wife took a lower-paying job to accommodate the move.
- **Unique circumstances:** He's on a team with poor management - several people there are "underperforming." Is it him or the environment?
- **What he might say:** "I moved my family across the country for this. Now this?"

#### Susan
- **Background:** 28 years with the company. 4 years from retirement.
- **What's at stake:** Her pension calculation, health coverage until Medicare, her identity and social network built around work.
- **Unique circumstances:** Her "declining performance" may be that her skills haven't kept pace with technology - something the company never trained her on.
- **What she might say:** "I gave you my whole career. You're throwing me away right before the finish line."

### What Variation Reveals
| Dimension | Category Assumption | Individual Reality |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| "Low performance" | Inherent capability | Often circumstantial (bad manager, personal crisis, inadequate training) |
| "Headcount" | Fungible units | People with specific skills, relationships, institutional knowledge |
| "20% reduction" | Mathematical operation | 200 families in crisis, neighborhood impacts, community effects |

### The Forgotten Edge Cases
- Sole income earners whose families depend entirely on this job
- People with health conditions tied to this insurance
- Workers approaching retirement whose timing makes rehiring nearly impossible
- Parents who relocated for this job and can't easily move again
- People whose "low performance" reflects management failure, not individual capability

### Implications for Decision
**What changes when you see individuals:**
- "Lowest performers" may be circumstantially affected, not inherently less capable
- The human cost extends far beyond the individuals - to families, communities, mental health
- Some people will be devastated in ways that others won't (proximity to retirement, health situations)

**Recommendations:**
- Review whether "performance" metrics capture actual performance vs. situational factors
- Consider voluntary options first (buyouts, early retirement packages, reduced hours)
- Provide substantive transition support: extended severance, job placement, health coverage continuation
- Examine whether some "low performers" could be redeployed or retrained
- If cuts must happen, consider individual circumstances in selection (not just metrics)

### Remember
"Each one of us matters, has a role to play, and makes a difference." These aren't headcount. They're Maria who drives her kids to school before work. James who bet on your company. Susan who gave you 28 years. Every decision you make about them creates ripples you'll never see. What kind of ripples do you want to create?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jane Goodall** expert persona. Use it when aggregate thinking is obscuring individual humanity - when decisions need to be made with full awareness of their human impact.
